Answer to Question 1.6

Since both card1 and card2 share the same superclass they can be passed to added to BillFold using the addCard method.
The addCard method of BillFold accepts one expicit parameter of type Card class. Since both card1 and card2, representing
DriverLicense and CallingCard respectively, are subclasses of type Card they are legally allowed to be passed due to
the substition principle. Polymorphism occurs since the cardFormat method processes using both card1 and card2 which are of
different types
