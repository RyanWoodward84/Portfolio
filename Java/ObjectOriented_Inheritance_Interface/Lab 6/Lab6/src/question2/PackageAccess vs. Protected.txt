How does package access variables differ from protected access variables?

Package access variables allow visiblity to anyone within the same class or package. Protected access variables
allow visiblity to anyone within the same class, package, or subclass. This would mean that the default access
variable would not allow you to see these variables if you are in a subclass. As a side note, although these variables
are visible within the same package for both package access and protected, in both cases the variables are not visible
if they are a part of a subpackage.
