For case 1:

If we are looking to throw a subscript range exception we need to look at the insert function and simply go from there.

Same with the find block and index. Simply copy what they have to find and return the block

for case 2 it seems like if the block size is just one then we can just remove the block itself

for case 3 it seems like its several blocks being pointed to by the array in the linked list. In this case we use a loop to shift the elements being pointed to, and then update the block size

Finally we have to update the array size
