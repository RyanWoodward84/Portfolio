Assignment 2 - Question 2
************************
a) If you try to print a message after the exec* call, does it print it? Why? Why not? 

The message will not be printed. This is because the exec* system call will load a binary file into memory. Once exec* is 
called any existing code is destroyed and replaced by the address space of the new program.

b) Who is the parent of your executable program? 

The parent of your executable program is the bash shell. The process init is considered to be the parent process of all
child processes.

c) How would you change the code so that the child and parent run concurrently?

In order to have the parent and child run concurrently the wait(NULL) command should be removed from testOS.c
This will prevent the parent process from waiting for the child process to complete in order to resume execution.
